# React Hooks

## Functional Component vs Class Component (understanding)

Q.
How is React class component different from functional component?

- more feature?
- better performance
- etc

Real:

**Function components capture the rendered values.**

## Why React Hooks?

1. Understanding `classe` is annoying as compared to simple `function`. (lots of boilerplate)
2. Hard to predict `this`
3. Duplicate logics (one in CDM or CDU etc)
4. Sharing non visual logics (react couples view and logic together, HOC)

## Things to do before learning hooks

1. Delete thinking in lifecycles.
2. Synchronization is how you think (all you always wanted to sync your state to your ui)

## Rules Of Hooks

1. Call order must be stable (no loops, conditions or nested functions)
2. Only call from function functional component or custom hooks (no classes)
3. Convention: Custom hooks name should start with `use` (helps the linters)

## Implement useTyping hook

## Implement useFetch hook

## Handeling State

- useState

  ðŸ‘‰ **Preserve value between renders and triggers re-render on change.**

  When ever a you execute a function the variables defined inside is created and garbage collected when execution is over. So there must be a place react storing the value to preserve it. `useState` is the api to preserve the value between two re-renders.

  - When you pass a function call to set the initial value of `useState` it will call that function every time component re-renders.

  ```js
  function expensiveFunction() {
    return 10919191;
  }
  let [value, setValue] = useState(expensiveFunction());
  // You shold pass that as reference no call
  let [value, setValue] = useState(expensiveFunction);
  ```

2. useReducer

   ðŸ‘‰

3. useRef

   ðŸ‘‰ Preserve value between renders and doesn't trigger re-render on change.

## Handeling side effect

4. useEffect

   ðŸ‘‰ This hook helps you manage side effects in the program. Side effect is anything that interacts with the outside of local environment of any function. There is three things in `useEffect`

   - add an effect
   - re-invoke the effect or not
   - remove the effect on unmount or next call

5) useLayoutEffect

## Optimazation

6. useCallback
7. useMemo

8. useContext
